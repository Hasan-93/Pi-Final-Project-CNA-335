<Ok>
```

### Static IP Needed

```
The Pi-hole is a SERVER so it needs a STATIC IP ADDRESS to function properly.                                                 
In the next section, you can choose to use your current network settings (DHCP) or to manually edit them.
<Ok>
```

```
Select Upstream DNS Provider. To use your own, select Custom.
Google (ECS)
<Ok>

```

```
Pi-hole relies on third party lists in order to block ads. 
You can use the suggestion below, and/or add your own after installation                                                       
To deselect the suggested list, use spacebar

<Ok>
```

```

(*) MalwareDom
<Ok>
```

### Static IP Address

```
Do you want to use your current network settings as a static  address?
IP address:    192.168.0.188/24  
Gateway:       192.168.0.1  
<Ok>
```

### FYI: IP Conflict

```
It is possible your router could still try to assign this IP to a  device, which would cause a conflict.  But in most cases the      
router is smart enough to not do that.                           
If you are worried, either manually set the address, or modify the
DHCP reservation pool so it does not include the IP you want.   
It is also possible to use a DHCP reservation, but if you are    
going to do that, you might as well set a static address.
<Ok>
